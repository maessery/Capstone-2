# NHL Salary Predictor

Contract negotiations in the NHL can be a lengthy, complex process, with General Managers trying to sign players for as little as possible while a player's agent aims to sign their client to the biggest contact they can. But which side's determination of a player's worth is the right one? Using machine learning I aim to resolve situations such as this by building a model that can output a salary based on 50 common and advanced player statistics. The ability to capture the value of a players production in dollars adds more transparency, efficiency, and consistency to how contracts are determined. As a result, both sides benefit: players receive fair pay proportional to their output, and General Managers get the best value for their pay. Fewer bad contracts thus increases a team's ability to assemble a better on-ice product, which benefits the players, Management, and the fan base.
