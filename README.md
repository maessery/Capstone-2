# NHL Salary Predictor

## 1. Problem Statement


Contract negotiations in the NHL can be a lengthy, complex process, with General Managers trying to sign players for as little as possible while a player's agent aims to sign their client to the biggest contact they can. But which side's determination of that player's worth is the right one? Using machine learning I aim to resolve situations such as this by building a model that can output a salary based on 50 common and advanced player statistics. This would add higher degrees of efficiency and consistency to the business side of the game, as well as allow General Managers to accomplish more.

How can a predictive salary model provide NHL teams a more efficient and consistent method for contract discussions between General Managers and Player Agents using all contractual and statistical data between the years of 2008 and 2021?



## 2.  The Data
The data came from two sources: Contract information came from www.capfriendly.com, statistics came from www.hockey-reference.com. When combined, the final dataset included 61 columns.
Since Skaters (Center, Left Wing, Right Wing, Defensemen) have different performance metrics than goalies, they were split up during EDA and modeling.
