# NHL-Salary-Predictor
## Springboard Data Science Career Track - Capstone 2


## 1. Problem Statement

How can a predictive salary model provide NHL teams a more efficient and consistent method for contract discussions between General Managers and Player Agents using all contractual and statistical data between the years of 2008 and 2021?



## 2.  The Data
The data came from two sources: Contract information came from www.capfriendly.com, statistics came from www.hockey-reference.com. When combined, the final dataset included 61 columns.
Since Skaters (Center, Left Wing, Right Wing, Defensemen) have different performance metrics than goalies, they were split up during EDA and modeling.

- **CF_Pct_rel** - Relative Corsi-For Percentage at Even-Strength; CF% - CFoff%; on ice corsi for % - off ice corsi for %

- **FF** - Fenwick-For at Even-Strength; shots + misses
